# FluentModelBuilder

Conventional, automated, and fluent way to configure the backing model of your DbContext.

* Class-based configuration
* Expression-based configuration
* Assembly-based discovery
* Alterations
* Entity Type Sources
* Conventions
* Entity Type Overrides
* Dependency injection support

All this while keeping in mind developers coming from background of [Fluent NHibernate](https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate), which this project is greatly inspired by.
